# Dynamic Programming

This repository contains implementations of various dynamic programming algorithms and problems in Java and Kotlin.

## Grid Traveller

The `GridTraveller` class provides a method to calculate the number of ways a traveler can move through a grid of size m x n. It utilizes memoization to optimize the recursive solution.

## Pascal's Triangle

The `generatePascalTriangle` function generates Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows. It demonstrates a dynamic programming approach to construct Pascal's triangle efficiently.

## How Sum

The `HowSum` class contains a method to find a combination of elements from a given array that sum up to a target value. Memoization is used to optimize the recursive solution.

## Can Sum

The `Target` class includes a method to determine whether a target sum can be achieved by summing elements from a given array. Memoization is employed to optimize the recursive solution.

## Tribonacci

The `Tribonacci` class provides a method to calculate the nth Tribonacci number. Memoization is utilized to optimize the recursive solution.

## Best Sum

The `bestSumMemo` function finds the shortest combination of elements from a given array that sum up to a target value. Memoization is employed to optimize the recursive solution.

## Can Construct

The `canConstruct` function checks if a target string can be constructed by concatenating elements from a given array of strings. Memoization is used to optimize the recursive solution.

## Fibonacci (Reversed)

The `fibo` class provides a method to calculate the nth Fibonacci number in reverse order. Memoization is utilized to optimize the recursive solution.
