# DynamicKotlin

This repository contains implementations of various dynamic programming algorithms and problems in Kotlin.

## Best Sum

The `bestSumMemo` function finds the shortest combination of elements from a given array that sum up to a target value. Memoization is employed to optimize the recursive solution.

## Can Construct

The `canConstruct` function checks if a target string can be constructed by concatenating elements from a given array of strings. Memoization is used to optimize the recursive solution.

## Pascal's Triangle

The `generatePascalTriangle` function generates Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows. It demonstrates a dynamic programming approach to construct Pascal's triangle efficiently.
